\chapter{Testing to inform evaluation}
\section{Testing methods}
In order to carry out testing to inform my project evaluation, I will use both alpha and beta testing methods (GeeksforGeeks, 2022). Alpha testing is a full workings test of the program utilising boundary and erroneous tests alongside the typical program functionality tests. The aim of alpha testing is to eliminate the bugs and check that each function works as it should. The alpha testing will be carried out by me as the developer. By comparison, beta testing will be carried out by the two stakeholders as listed in the analysis section of this report. It aims to test the program in the real-world application the project was designed for. This will mean the stakeholders will walk through and test whether they can login, create listings, bid on listings and other regular functions of the website. Beta testing will ensure that there are no major regular running areas before the project is launched.
